# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Classification using Transfer Learning (ResNet50)

## 1. **Problem Statement**

This project builds a **deep learning image classification model** to identify five categories of flowers â€” *daisy*, *dandelion*, *roses*, *sunflowers*, and *tulips*.
By leveraging **transfer learning with ResNet50**, the model achieves **high-accuracy predictive insights** that can support **botanical research, garden automation, and plant monitoring applications**.

## 2. **Dataset Overview**

* **Source**: [TensorFlow Flower Photos Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz)
* **Size**: 3,670 images, 5 classes
* **Classes**:

  1. Daisy
  2. Dandelion
  3. Roses
  4. Sunflowers
  5. Tulips
* **Image Dimensions**: Resized to **180Ã—180 px** for uniformity
* **Data Split**:

  * Training: 2,936 images (80%)
  * Validation: 734 images (20%)
* **Type**: RGB color images

---

## 3. **Data Collection & Cleaning**

* **Automated download** from the TensorFlow public dataset repository
* **Preprocessing steps**:

  * Image resizing to `(180, 180, 3)`
  * Normalization to scale pixel values
  * Dataset splitting into training and validation sets
* **Data integrity check** to ensure correct class labeling

---

## 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* **Class distribution**: Nearly balanced across the 5 categories
* **Sample visualization**: Grid display of random training images per class
* Observed **intra-class variation** (e.g., roses with different colors and lighting conditions)
* **Business insight**: Model needs to be robust to background noise and color differences

## 6. **Model Evaluation**

| Metric       | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Accuracy** | 100%              | 88.69%              |
| **Loss**     | 0.0028            | 0.3923              |

**Insights**:

* The model converges quickly due to pre-trained features.
* Slight overfitting observed after 5th epoch â€” can be addressed via fine-tuning or regularization.
